
The main() function allocates a global list structure. 
Through the nodes, an association between index (1, 2, ...) and letter ('b', 'c', ...) is made. 
Then the password checking function looks for the letters that match with the following node indexes: [20, 13, 8, 1, 20, 2].
These indexes correspond to the password: unibuc.
