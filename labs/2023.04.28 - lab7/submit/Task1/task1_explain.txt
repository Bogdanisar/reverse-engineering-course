
Why did the extraction work?
	We open the file in CFF Explorer. The FileDescription field says "Win32 Cabinet Self-Extractor", which means the file is supposed to be extracted. 
	Also, if we open the file in IDA, we see that the file is recognized as "Microsoft.Net assembly" and IDA shows us some instructions.
